This is THE Dart Ranking software for Syntronic R&D AB at Lindholmen.

This repository contains the match history, elo history and software to update these. Only the python script and .csv-files ('MatchHistory', 'Elos') are necessary to add a game. The notebook is only used for testing purposes and the information written
there is outdated.

Run the python script to lanch the GUI and follow the instructions.
