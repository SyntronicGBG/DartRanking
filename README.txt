This is THE Dart Ranking software for Syntronic R&D AB at Lindholmen.

This repository contains the match history, elo history and software to update these. Only the python script and .csv-files ('MatchHistory', 'Elos') are necessary to add a game. The notebook is only used for testing purposes and the information written there is outdated.

Run the python script to lanch the GUI and follow the instructions. After a match has been recorded you simply push the changes of the files MatchHistory and Elos to this repo.
If you find any bugs, have suggestions of improvement or have any questions, feel free to ask Agaton or anyone else on site!
